# Binary-to-Gray-Code-Converter-Cadence-Virtuoso-GPDK-90nm-
Design and implementation of a **Binary to Gray code converter** using **NAND-based XOR gates** in **Cadence Virtuoso (GPDK 90nm)**.   The project was developed step by step: NAND gate → XOR gate (using NAND) → 4-bit Binary to Gray converter. Each block was designed, symbolized, tested with a testbench, and functionally verified
